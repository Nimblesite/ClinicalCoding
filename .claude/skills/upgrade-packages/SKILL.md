# Upgrade Packages

Upgrade all project dependencies to their latest compatible (or latest major, if `--major`) versions for HealthcareSamples (C#/.NET primary, Python embedding service + scripts).

## Arguments

- `--check-only` — List outdated packages without upgrading. Stop after Step 2.
- `--major` — Include major version bumps (breaking changes). Without this flag, stay within semver-compatible ranges.
- Any other argument is treated as a specific package name to upgrade (instead of all packages).

## Step 1 — Detect language and package manager

Inspect the repo for these manifest files:

| Manifest file | Language | Package manager |
|---|---|---|
| `*.csproj` / `*.sln` | C# / .NET | NuGet (dotnet) |
| `Directory.Build.props` | C# / .NET | NuGet (dotnet) — central version pinning |
| `requirements.txt` | Python (ICD10/embedding-service, ICD10/scripts/CreateDb) | pip |

This repo uses both. Process .NET first, then Python.

## Step 2 — List outdated packages

Run the appropriate command BEFORE upgrading anything. Show the user what will change.

### C# / .NET (NuGet)
```bash
dotnet list HealthcareSamples.sln package --outdated
```
For transitive dependencies too: `dotnet list HealthcareSamples.sln package --outdated --include-transitive`

**Read the docs:** https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-list-package

### Python (pip)
The Python pieces use plain `requirements.txt` files. Install each in a venv and run `pip list --outdated`:
```bash
# embedding service
python -m venv /tmp/embedding-venv
/tmp/embedding-venv/bin/pip install -r ICD10/embedding-service/requirements.txt
/tmp/embedding-venv/bin/pip list --outdated

# DB scripts
python -m venv /tmp/scripts-venv
/tmp/scripts-venv/bin/pip install -r ICD10/scripts/CreateDb/requirements.txt
/tmp/scripts-venv/bin/pip list --outdated
```

**Read the docs:** https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/#cmdoption-U

If `--check-only` was passed, **stop here** and report the outdated list.

## Step 3 — Read the official upgrade docs

**Before running any upgrade command, you MUST fetch and read the official documentation URL listed above for the detected package manager.** Use WebFetch to retrieve the page. This ensures you use the correct flags and understand the behavior. Do not guess at flags or options from memory.

## Step 4 — Upgrade packages

Run the upgrade. If a specific package name was given as an argument, upgrade only that package.

### C# / .NET (NuGet)
There is NO single `dotnet upgrade-all` command. You must upgrade each package individually:
```bash
# For each outdated package from Step 2:
dotnet add <project.csproj> package <PackageName>    # upgrades to latest
# Or with specific version:
dotnet add <project.csproj> package <PackageName> --version <version>
```
For `Directory.Build.props`, edit the version numbers directly in the XML.

**Read the docs:** https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-add-package

Alternatively, use the dotnet-outdated global tool:
```bash
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-outdated-tool
dotnet outdated --upgrade
```
**Read the docs:** https://github.com/dotnet-outdated/dotnet-outdated

### Python (pip)
For `requirements.txt`:
```bash
/tmp/embedding-venv/bin/pip install --upgrade -r ICD10/embedding-service/requirements.txt
/tmp/embedding-venv/bin/pip freeze > ICD10/embedding-service/requirements.txt

/tmp/scripts-venv/bin/pip install --upgrade -r ICD10/scripts/CreateDb/requirements.txt
/tmp/scripts-venv/bin/pip freeze > ICD10/scripts/CreateDb/requirements.txt
```

## Step 5 — Verify the upgrade

After upgrading, run the project's build and test suite to confirm nothing broke:

```bash
make ci
```

If tests fail:
1. Read the failure output carefully
2. Check the changelog / migration guide for the upgraded packages (fetch the release notes URL if available)
3. Fix breaking changes in the code
4. Re-run tests
5. If stuck after 3 attempts on the same failure, report it to the user with the error details and the package that caused it

## Step 6 — Report

Provide a summary:

- Packages upgraded (old version -> new version)
- Packages skipped (and why, e.g., major version bump without `--major` flag)
- Build/test result after upgrade
- Any breaking changes that were fixed
- Any packages that could not be upgraded (with error details)

## Rules

- **Always list outdated packages first** before upgrading anything
- **Always read the official docs** for the package manager before running upgrade commands
- **Always run tests after upgrading** to catch breakage immediately
- **Never remove packages** unless they were explicitly deprecated and replaced
- **Never downgrade packages** unless rolling back a broken upgrade
- **Never modify lockfiles manually** — let the package manager regenerate them
- **Commit nothing** — leave changes in the working tree for the user to review

## Success criteria

- All outdated packages upgraded to latest compatible (or latest major if `--major`)
- Build passes
- Tests pass
- User has a clear summary of what changed
